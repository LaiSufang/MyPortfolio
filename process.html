      <h2>How I Built this Website?</h2>
      <p>
        Creating my portfolio website was an exciting journey—a process that
        combined creativity, logic, and a lot of coffee! Every step, from
        understanding what I wanted this website to achieve to perfecting its
        final design, taught me valuable lessons about planning, design, and
        implementation. Here's a behind-the-scenes look at how I built my
        website, step by step.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 1: Understand the Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Every great project starts with a clear goal, and my website was no
        exception. I asked myself some key questions to define the purpose of
        this portfolio: What's the goal of my website? Who's the audience? What
        results do I expect?
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of my website is to showcase my skills, projects, and
        professional experience in a way that resonates with potential employers
        and collaborators. My target audience includes recruiters, hiring
        managers, and peers in the tech and design industry. They need a website
        that's professional yet creative, functional yet visually appealing. I
        aim for visitors to gain a clear understanding of my abilities and feel
        inspired to reach out with collaboration opportunities or professional
        engagements.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2: Website Structure</h3>
      <p>
        With the project's purpose and audience defined, I moved on to the
        structure of the site. How many pages? What content to include in each
        page? With these questions in mind, I decided on a multiple-page
        structure for easy navigation:
      </p>
      <ul class="step2-container">
        <li>
          <strong>Home:</strong> a quick overview of my website, a concise
          introduction and a hero image.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>About:</strong> a deeper dive into my journey, roles, and
          values.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Portfolio: </strong>a selection of projects with links for
          detailed exploration.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Process:</strong> a space to share my work process.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact:</strong> a clean form and clickable links to my email
          and social media.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 3: Wireframe</h3>
      <p>
        Wireframing allowed me to visualize the website's design and navigation
        before jumping into code. I focused on making navigation intuitive and
        content accessible. A consistent header and footer with links ensured
        visitors could move seamlessly between pages.
      </p>

      <img
        class="wireframe-images"
        src="./img/wireframe.png"
        alt="wireframe of my website"
      />
      <p class="figure-captions">Figure 1. Wireframe</p>

      <h3>Step 4: Website Design</h3>
      <p>
        This was the fun part—choosing the aesthetics to bring my vision to
        life. I focused on the key visual elements including color scheme,
        typography, and designing other visual assets like icons, logo, and hero
        images, etc.
      </p>

      <div class="image-container">
        <img
          class="design-images"
          src="./img/colorAndFonts.png"
          alt="Color scheme, topography, logo & icons"
        />
      </div>
      <p class="figure-captions">Figure 2. Visual assets</p>

      <h3>Step 5: Build the Website</h3>
      <p>
        Now came the technical part—building the website. I started with
        semantic HTML, organizing the content logically with clear headings,
        sections, and accessibility in mind. Then I wrote custom CSS for
        layouts, styles, and responsive behavior. This was where the design
        truly came to life.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 6: Finalize and Iterate</h3>
      <p>
        The final step was all about refining the website to ensure a polished
        and professional result. Key improvements include: adjusting spacing,
        alignment, and color contrast for better readability, optimizing image
        sizes, implementing media queries for responsiveness, testing and
        iterating overall functionality and experience.
      </p>
